# Watering-Monitoring_System
## Description 
In this project, I have went through the process of builiding a monitoring system for my bamboo, with a **Raspberry Pi (Model 2B+)**.  
With the help of the data I have collected and a little bit of machine learning, I optimized the amount of water it needs to grow as fast as it can. During the project,
one can learn a lot about programming, engineering and machine learning as well. In addition, you get to see your plant grow which is always nice.\
