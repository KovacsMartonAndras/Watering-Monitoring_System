# Watering-Monitoring_System
## Description 
In this project, I have went through the process of builiding a monitoring system for my bamboo, with a Raspberry Pi (Model 2B+).  
With the help of the data I have collected, I optimized the amount of water it needs to grow as fast as it can. During the project,
one can learn a lot about programming, engineering and machinbe learning as well. In addition, you get to see your plant grow which is always nice.\
